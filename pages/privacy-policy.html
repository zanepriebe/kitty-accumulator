        At Fredno Studios, we care about your privacy as much as you do. The only user data we
        collect within Kitty Accumulator is used to enable Google Play achievements and leaderboards.
        To enable these features, we use your Google account credentials to retrieve your achievements
        and leaderboard information and update it as needed. We don't sell this data and we don't save
        it. As soon as you quit the app, this data is destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        By prioritizing user privacy, we hope to make Kitty Accumulator a fun and safe experience
        for all ages. Thanks for taking the time to read our privacy policy and happy accumulating!
